            "preparation": {
                "1": "Detailed step 1 instruction.",
                "2": "Detailed step 2 instruction.",
                "3": "Detailed step 3 instruction.",
                "...": "Additional detailed steps if needed."
            }
        },
        "Recipe Name 2": {
            "preparation": {
                "1": "Detailed step 1 instruction.",
                "2": "Detailed step 2 instruction.",
                "3": "Detailed step 3 instruction.",
                "...": "Additional detailed steps if needed."
            }
        }
    }
}

Ingredients: {inputString}

Requirements:
- Provide detailed and clear instructions for each preparation step.
- The number of steps should vary as needed for each recipe, with no fixed limit.
- Ensure all steps include precise actions, cooking techniques, and timing (e.g., "Simmer for 15 minutes until the sauce thickens").
- Avoid any additional commentary, markdown formatting, or code block symbols such as ```json or backticks.
- The response must be a valid JSON object with proper syntax, using double quotes around all keys and string values.
